When I became pregnant, I stalked the internet looking for all the material I could find on pregnancy; what to expect and what to do. I read more articles than I can count and watched as many videos as my eyes could handle.

The truth is I wanted to find out everything there was to know about being pregnant. I looked up every little feeling, twitch and ache I felt.

During my doctorâ€™s visits, I was armed with a list of questions. I had the doctor explain everything to me in detail (much of which I now donâ€™t remember ðŸ˜‰ ). I downloaded apps on my phone, I had a day to day guide throughout the pregnancy. I knew what was going on in my body or at leastÂ I felt aware.

That was all good, however,Â I did not do enough research on what would happen after the baby was born. My research ended at the delivery point. I would say, the real work began after I brought the baby home from the hospital. I realized that things were not what I thought they would be.

Donâ€™t get me wrong, having my baby home was an indescribable feeling, but I wished I had prepared better.Â For instance, I overdressed my baby and he ended up with a terrible heat rash. We had to be admitted to the hospital for seven days when he was only eight days old.

Here are some things I think that you should know and prepare for.

## **_Bathing and Dressing the baby_**

Babies are very delicate. They are affected by pretty much everything because their immune systems are still developing. Everybody told me to keep the baby warm and that I did. More like I overdid it.

My poor baby was so warm, he ended up with an infection that put him in the hospital only 8 days after he was born. Depending on the weather in your area, you should learn how many layers of clothing are just right so that you do not overdo it or under do it.

Find out from your doctor how many times in a week you should give your baby a bath. And also very important, learn how to do it. You will get all sorts of advice from everyone on these topics but I would advise you listen to your doctor and do what you feel is right for your baby.

I gave my baby a bath every day and he was okay. Some people will opt to bathe their babies 3 to 4 times a week and so on. Again babies are different and as a parent, you know what is best for your baby.

## **_Sleep deprivation_**

<p class="text-center">

</p>

The advice I was given was that after the baby came all the pain would disappear completely. Well, the truth to that is, the labour painsÂ do disappear when the baby comes but what they fail to tell you is that what follows is major fatigue.

Being in labour for hours on end, then the actual process of giving birth leaves your body depleted of all energy. Not to mention all the hours that you were in labour, you did not sleep a wink. In my case, I was in labour for 14hours.Â After I had gone through the whole experience, I could not stand on my feet long enough to even dress the baby. I was dead tired.

All I wanted to do was sleep but another realization sets in. You can not just black out because now you have a baby to watch over and take care of. Not to mention that this is a totally new human being who has never been in this world before.

You feel the need to just observe and make sure that he/she is okay and that the environment is just right; not too cold and not too hot, that there is no breeze or dust that would make yourÂ baby sneeze or get a cold.

To be honest, IÂ wanted to be awake and just stare at my beautiful baby. I couldnâ€™tÂ believe that he was finally with me. However, I did fall asleep for some time. The funny moment was when I woke up and saw the baby beside me, I got startled.Â  Having the baby with me was a new experience.

</p>

Babies feed every two or so hours, which means that day or night you canâ€™t sleep for more than two hours consecutively. And it is also not easy to sleep when the baby is awake unless you have someone you trust taking care of the baby.

My newborn took short naps during the day so even though I was advised to sleep while the baby slept, it was not easy because he was not asleep long enough for me to catch any sleep. The moment I fell asleep, the baby would wake up.

Sleep deprivation is a real struggle for new mums. The good news is that their sleep patterns improve with time and eventually you will be able to have more than 4 hours of sleep a night. However, there are babies who are such good sleepers and I guess such mums are able to rest more.

If your baby is not one of the good sleepers, I would suggest you get someone you trust, like a friend or relative to take care of the baby for a while so that you can be able to catch some sleep.

## Â **_Time to recover_**

<p class="text-center">

</p>

Carrying a baby inside you for nine months can take a toll on your body. It takes a while to recover. A lot of changes occur in your body while you are pregnant to accommodate the baby.

After delivery, your body starts to go back to how it was before pregnancy. And there is also healing from the actual delivery. Be it cesarean section or normal delivery, they all leave you with some healing to do. During this time, you can not do much.

Actually, you are adviced against heavy work. It takes sometime before you can start doing things that you used to do before you got pregnant. Take it easy and eat healthy meals so that you can regain your strength faster. It all gets better with time.

## **_Breastfeeding and bottle feeding_**

<p class="text-center">

</p>

It is recommended that you breastfeed your baby exclusively for the first six months of his/her life. What this means is that your baby only drinks your breast milk and nothing else for this period of time.

You can choose to feed directly from the breast or you can express the milk and feed the baby from a bottle or combine both methods. Some women actually chose to express from the first day and feed the baby from a bottle and never directly from the breast.

</p>

There are some people who for one reason or another choose to formula feed their babies or combine both breastfeeding and formula feeding. It could be due to lack of enough breastmilk or just a preference, again we are all different and we make different choices when it comes to raising our little ones.

What I would say is just be prepared for anything when it comes to breastfeeding. For some women, the milk doesnâ€™t come in until later so the baby has to get started on formula besides having made the decision to exclusively breastfeed. (I have a friend whose milk came in 4 days after delivery, she was very frustrated because her desire was to exclusively breastfeed her baby).

For some women, the milk supply dries up after a few months and they have to stop breastfeeding and start formula feeding.

There are other challenges that come with breastfeeding, like the sore, cracked and bleeding nipples which can be such a painful ordeal. If your baby doesnâ€™t latch on well, then you stand a risk of suffering from this.

Other women suffer from mastitis which is an infection in the milk ducts. This happens when the milk ducts get clogged. It is also very painful and requires treatment.

_To avoid these challenges, you need to learn how to latch your baby properly_. Itâ€™s not as easy as it looks or sounds especially in the beginning. That said, breastfeeding is the best bonding time for mummy and baby.

> When the baby looks up into your eyes and it looks like he is trying to cram your face so that he never forgets youâ€¦_oh it is such an amazing feeling_!

Decide what works best for you and your baby. And go with it.

Oh and remember, babies need to be burped after feeding. This is because they tend to swallow air while feeding and if they donâ€™t release that air, they keep spitting up.

Babies who are bottle fed may need to be burped more often than those who are breastfed.

## _**Vaccination**_

I am not a medical professional so I will refrain from giving advice on this. Talk to your doctor about the necessary vaccinations and when they are offered and what the side effects of the vaccinations are and how to deal with them.

My babyâ€™s thighs swelled up and he became feverish. But the paediatrician had already prepared me for this so I knew how to deal with it.

## _**Conclusion**_

I hope this will help you as you prepare to bring your baby home.

Remember, everyone will have advice and opinions about how you should bring your baby up. Take what is useful and discard the rest, otherwise, you will drive yourself crazy.

I wish you a nice and happy time taking care of your little one.
