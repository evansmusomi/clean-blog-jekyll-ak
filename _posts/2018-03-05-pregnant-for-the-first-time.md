Being a mum is one of the most amazing feelings ever. For me, nothing quite compares, it is a special feeling that I can not even describe.

From feeling your baby move around in your tummy and watching your belly grow a little every day to when you go through the magical experience of giving birth and the overwhelming joy and love that you feel the moment you hold your baby in your arms for the first time.

But it is not all sweets and roses. The moment you discover that you are pregnant, you become overwhelmed by an array of emotions. No matter how prepared (or not) you were, there is almost always a moment of doubt, especially for first-time mums.

The reality of it all dawns on you. You start to wonder if you are really, truly ready for this. You wonder whether you have the proper mum skills to mould a child into a responsible human being.

Let’s face it, every mother wants the best for their child and how our children turn out largely depend on what we teach them from the moment they enter into this world.

When I was pregnant with my now 15-month-old son, I went through the motions too. I was very happy since I had always wanted to be a mum but sometimes I would be filled with all sorts of fears and worries.

I worried about finances, I worried about our house, I worried about his education, I wondered whether I was going to be a good mum, I even worried about changing diapers…LOL. I worried about pretty much everything.

I wondered how my baby was going to look like. I wondered if he was okay, I wished I could just meet him already and confirm that he was a bouncing, healthy bundle of joy.

And then comes the changes. Our bodies go through so many changes to accommodate the growing little one. I am no doctor but I know there are major hormonal changes that occur which affect how we feel. The fatigue sets in, the morning sickness (characterized by nausea and vomiting, which by the way can happen at any time of the day), mood swings and even our senses of smell and taste get affected.

You might also experience a little cramping during the first trimester. To be honest, for the first three months of pregnancy I didn’t feel like myself at all.

And don’t forget about the cravings…oh those cravings, I craved chicken all the time which led to me gaining a bit more weight than I would have wanted to.

That brings me to my next point, weight gain, please note, this is not the time to go on diet. You should eat healthy meals so that your baby can get the required nutrients to grow. As the baby grows, you are going to experience some weight gain.

The weight comes from all the changes that take place; increased blood volume, increased fluid volume, the weight of the uterus, weight of breast tissue, the placenta and the baby’s weight.

As you go further along, you will also increase the number of calories you consume in a day but not by so much. Some women take “eating for two” quite literally and end up gaining so much weight (like I did).

As you continue with this incredible journey, more and more changes occur. Most of these changes feel okay but there are those that don’t feel so good. My worst was nausea and heartburn but hey, it’s only for a short period of time and then it all goes away and leaves you with the most beautiful gift.

For most women, the first trimester is the hardest but come the second, you start to feel more like yourself and start to really enjoy the journey, even your energy levels go up. Towards the end, you tend to get tired very quickly and cannot handle much activity. Although some women are able to stay active until the end, God bless them!

Don’t forget about the fourth trimester. The first three months after delivery are actually another trimester. This is where you are getting acquainted with your baby, knowing when and how to feed them, when and how to put them down for naps, how to change diapers, how to bathe and dress them and trying to figure out what their different cries communicate. Not forgetting that your body is also healing so you are not really operating at a 100 percent.

Fatigue and sleep deprivation are some of the things to expect at this stage (newborns feed every two hours or so, night feedings are a sure thing). Some babies sleep very well though, so you might just be one of those lucky mums. All in all, all this is just for a short period of time. Things get better as you go along, as your body recovers and as the baby grows.

It really is quite a journey, an amazing journey to motherhood. All of you expecting mothers, I’d like to encourage you to stay strong, eat healthy meals, stay active and enjoy the attention and care that you will receive from pretty much everyone. And don’t miss your doctor’s appointments (very important).

I wish you all the best.
