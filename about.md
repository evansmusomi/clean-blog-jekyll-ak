Always a Wife, Mum and Student of Life.

I empower women through dance as a co-founder, instructor and dancer at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dancekike/" target="_blank">KIKE Dance</a>. ðŸ’ƒ

I help people look and feel good through my hair and cosmetics business based in Nairobi. ðŸ’„ðŸ’…

I want to build a better world and I'm learning to win at relationships and helping others do the same. ðŸ’– ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥‚

**Coz the world runs on relationships.**

Partly by studying psychology and sociology at the University of Nairobi. The rest of the time by leveraging as many opportunities each day to be a better me for the greater good!
